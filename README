AA
==

Introduction
============

aa    = Main interface (aa start, aa alert 'foo', aa stop)
aad   = Daemon started by aa (or could we use just threads from aa?)

Installing
==========

First of all, define your nickname:

    $ export NICKNAME='your nickname here'

Add that to the end of your ~/.bashrc.

Put aa.py on your /usr/local/bin:

    $ sudo cp aa.py /usr/local/bin/aa

Using
=====

Now you can use:

    $ aa start         ... start your session
    $ aa alert 'foo'   ... alert 'foo'
    $ aa stop          ... stop your session
