AA
==

Introduction
============

aa    = Main interface (aa start, aa alert 'foo', aa stop)
aad   = Daemon started by aa (or could we use just threads from aa?)

Installing
==========

Put aa.py on your /usr/local/bin:

    $ sudo cp aa.py /usr/local/bin/aa

Or just create a link:

    $ sudo ln -s /path/to/aa.py /usr/local/bin/aa

Using
=====

Now you can use:

    $ aa start                    ... start your session
    $ aa alert 'foo'              ... alert 'foo'
    $ aa stop                     ... stop your session
    $ aa config nickname yournick ... set your nickname

For now, just 'aa stop' will send your 'work log' to the server. You
can see your log at http://nightsc.com.br/aa
